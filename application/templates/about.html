		<h2>How We Started</h2>
		<p>We started Two Piece back in 2023 with a dream to make it easier for One Piece fans to buy affordable and high-quality products.</p>
		<p>We took our products to Disneyland, where we put up a big sign asking people if they thought we should give up our jobs to make mugs and posters with One Piece characters on them. Underneath the sign, we had a QR code that took people to a website where they could vote 'yes' or 'no. 
            At the end of the weekend, we tallied up the votes and it turned out that 100$ of the votes were for 'yes', so we resigned from our jobs the next day and got cracking.</p>
		<p>A few hours after being job-free, we found out that the 'no' button was, in fact, broken. </p>

        <p>A month later, we had a fully functional website, enough products to fill a medium-sized swimming pool with, and zero tolerance for the bloke who created our initial voting poll.</p>
