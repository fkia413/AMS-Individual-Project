## 1. Project Overview

I have created an online storefront that fully conforms to a provided client specification. The website was made with ease of use and attractiveness in mind, and provides information about various products, product categories, pricing, and upcoming sales. 

I have used the following technologies in my project:

1. Kanban (via Jira) for project management and agile framework
2. Git as the version control system
3. GitHub for source code management 
4. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap for front-end development
5. Python as the back-end programming language
6. Flask as the API development platform
7. MySQL as the database management system

My overarching objective for this project was to create a fully functioning application with full documentation around utilisation of the supporting tools and technologies. 

## 2. How I used Agile Methodology

I spent 10 minutes at the start of each day planning what I would work on. I sorted my tasks by priority, where the MVP tasks were at the top. I planned my work time in time slots of 2 hours, with a 10 minute break after. The typical day consisted of 4 time slots of 2 hours. This meant that I was able to give ample time to my project and ensure that I covered not only all of the MVPs, but also the extra features. I counted a sprint as 2 days of work, and at the end of each sprint i.e. on Friday evening, Sunday evening and Tuesday evening, I reviewed the progress that I made and planned the work for my next sprint accordingly. I didn't overcomplicate my planning because it was an individual project so I didn't have to manage a team's workload. 

## 3. How I used my Kanban board

### Epics, User Stories, Tasks and Acceptance Criteria

I created 7 user stories that encompassed the key areas of my project, including the home page and log in button. Inside each of my user stories, I stored all of the related tasks to keep it well-structured. I also included acceptance criteria in the description of the user stories to make my objectives more clear.

I also included some risks which I put in my risk assessment in the next section.

### Risk Assessment

This displays some of the risks that I may have encountered during the project, including the steps to mitigate any negative impacts. Based on this risk assessment, I was able to make changed to my code to decrease the possibility of the risks happening. 

### Evolution of Ideas

I had a lot of ideas for what I wanted the front-end to look like and the functionality I wanted. An example of this is the home page. I wanted the home page to have a carousel that switches between 3 images and can be manually controlled while also having the functionality to switch automatically. I encountered a lot of errors with it at first. One error was that the carousel indicators to manually change it were at the bottom of the website below the footer instead of at the bottom of the images. I fixed this by trying different code and using w3schools. Here is the difference in the code (before and after).

### Summary of Kanban board

Here are some images of what my Kanban board looked like at the beginning, middle and end.

## 4. How I used Feature-Branch Model

I made 2 feature branches - 1 for html and one for back end. Here is the screenshot of the insights graph:

These are the tables I have. They all have some relation to each other.

## 6. Jenkins section

I used Jenkins as a pipeline to open my website while I was working on it. Jenkins also handled my test automation. The majority of the tests failed, but some of them passed.

## 7. Future Steps

If I continued with this project, I'd work on making all of the front-end look and feel fantastic. I'd also add more products for customers to buy. 

## 8. Licensing

I used VSCode for the code and SQLLite for database. 

## Contributors

W3schools, Qa community, bootstrap.
