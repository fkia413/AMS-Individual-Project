# Plan

1. Set up KanBan board - done
2. Plan out Agile - pending
3. Set up Git feature branch model
4. Look on YouTube for ideas for One Piece
5. Build website (est 8 hours 10 mins)

## Questions

1. Ask where to put acceptance criteria in Kanban board and show what I've done so far
2. We can't put sprints onto a Kanban board??? But the brief says we need to so do we just write it down?
3. We can't do pull requests since we're solo right?
4. Akber will ask about the payment page
5. The feature branch thing for github like do we take screenshots of our bash terminal orrr

## Project Specification: QA Store

Create an online storefront

fully conforming to a provided client specification.

easy-to-use and attractive website 

that provides information about various products, product categories, pricing, and upcoming sales.

## Scope

***AGILE*** utilisation of Sprints, user stories, acceptance criteria, story points. Prioritisation of these features is the key to success. There is time for two 2-day Sprints before the site is scheduled to "go live". take 10 minutes in each morning to plan out your day. the rest should be fine even solo. write down sprints where i plan what to do each time. 

***KANBAN via JIRA*** full expansion on user stories and tasks needed to complete the project - The user stories should be on the project management board, which you can then include screenshot(s) of in the README. you can even put a task breakdown into the description of each of your user stories if you want to keep it well structured. create user stories for the new optional ones like logo as well. keep taking screenshots of kanban board so right at the beginning without having added in user stories, then once you've added, then at the end. put acceptance criteria in description of user story. 

along with a record of any issues or risks encountered during project creation.-> required to track your designs and workflow throughout the duration of the project, with emphasis on how Agile methodology shaped the application over time. (kanban board for the planning stage. The screenshots would be in the README of the repo (which will act as the documentation for the project). You could put a description of what you did in the README if you prefer)

***GITHUB*** Code integrated into a central repository on a Version Control System, utilizing issues, pull requests, merge requests, and any other aspects deemed appropriate.-> You will be required to utilize the Feature-Branch Model, and to push a working copy of your code to the main branch regularly. It is recommended to use the feature- naming strategy for your feature branches. just have 2 branches and call them feature-html and feature-backend. screenshot the insights page with the graph for evidence

***MySQL*** Database Management System

***PYTHON*** Back-End Programming Language

***FLASK*** API Development Platform

***HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT*** Front-End Development Framework, use Bootstrap

You should consider the concept of MVP (Minimum Viable Product) as you plan your project.

Ensure that you complete all the Client requirements before adding extra functionality that is not explicitly specified.

## Deliverable

full documentation around utilisation of supporting tools

fully functioning application

## Website Requirements (7.5 hours)

These requirements are regarded by the client as essential components of the online storefront, thus they should be part of your Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

### Home Page - 1.5 hours, use Bootstrap 2:40

The online storefront should have a welcoming home page. The home page shall:

1. Be visually appealing
2. Serve as the default for the entire site. Allow users to navigate to other sections of the site from here
3. Communicate the site's purpose to the visitors. Have pictures or graphics that are relevant to the products being sold

### Product Listing Page - 1 hour

The site needs a page that lists all available products. This page should:

Be part of the overall site navigation

Display product images, descriptions, and pricing

Have at least 4 different product images on display

Each product should have its own dedicated page with more details

### Category Page - 1 hour

The site should have a page dedicated to product categories. This page should:

Be part of the overall site navigation

Display different product categories

Provide users the ability to view products by category

### Cart Page = 1 hour

The site should have a dedicated page for the shopping cart. This page should:

Show all products added by the user to the cart

Display the total price of all products in the cart

Provide users the ability to modify the quantity of each product in the cart

Have an option to proceed to the checkout page

### Checkout Page - 1 hour

The site should have a page dedicated to checking out. This page should:

Be part of the overall site navigation

Display a summary of the cart

Allow users to enter their shipping information

### Payment Page - 1 hour

The site needs a page for processing payments. This page should:

Be part of the overall site navigation

Collect payment information from the users such as cardholder's name, card number, expiry date, and security code/CVC

Include a mechanism for passing on the payment details to a mock external payment processor

(just a mock one, able to add up what's in a basket)

### Contact Us Page - 30 mins

The site should have a page dedicated to providing contact information for the store. This page should:

Be part of the overall site navigation

Include store address, phone number, and email

Include a contact form for users to submit inquiries or feedback

### About Us Page - 30 mins

There should be an About Us page. This page should:

Be part of the overall site navigation

Provide information about the store, its mission, and its history

Include information about the team behind the store

In addition to the requirements above, the website should maintain a uniform look and feel across all pages. The navigation menu should be consistent and easily accessible. The website should also be mobile-responsive to ensure a pleasant shopping experience on all devices.

The site's design should align with the brand's identity and appeal to the target audience. Colours, fonts, and imagery should be selected thoughtfully to create a cohesive and engaging user experience. The site should also load quickly to retain user attention and minimize bounce rates.

All of these are deemed as 'essential' components and should be part of your Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Complete them as soon as possible and then consider adding 'desirable' features.

## Website Wishlist (1h 10mins)

These are considered 'desirable' components of the online storefront by the Client, and therefore should not be part of your MVP, but can be added later on.

### Search Functionality - 15 mins

The site should allow users to search for products.

Be accessible from all pages of the site

Return a list of products that match the search criteria

### Page Header & Footer - 15 mins

Each page of the site should contain a consistent header and footer, with links to commonly accessed pages.

The footer should be identical on all pages of the site.

The footer should link to the Home Page, About Us, and Contact Page.

### Development Process Description - 20 mins

The About Us page should include a description of the development process used to build the site.

The page should link to various resources that provide further insight into the specific technologies used (Python, Flask, MySQL etc.)

The page should describe the development process at a high level.

The page should explain how the team used Git and Jenkins for version control and how it affected the creation of the site. (You can add Jenkins functionality if you like, but it's not part of the MVP. Plus you can't really use the full functionality of Jenkins until you start looking at docker too)

The section of the page dedicated to this content should be visibly distinct and separate from the other content on the page.

<!-- ### Custom Logo - pixlr, 20 mins -->

<!-- The site should have a custom logo on the front page that depicts the siteâ€™s name and a graphic relevant to the products being sold.

The logo must be original.

The logo may incorporate elements from other images with due credits.

The logo must appear on the front page.

The logo should complement the overall design and aesthetic of the site.

Please note, while these features would certainly enhance the user experience of the online storefront, they are not essential for the initial version of the site. Therefore, they should be considered for future development phases. -->

## Extra notes

meet 1:30, 4:30

Workshops aren't strictly marked like 'projects'. It's more of a feedback at the end kind of thing than getting a particular mark

If you wish to use any technologies which have not been covered as part of your training, you must consult your trainer first.

All supporting documentation for your project should be included in your remote repository at the close of business on the day of presenting your project.

are we presenting it to anyone at the end?

Create draw diagrams on draw.io and add it to README
